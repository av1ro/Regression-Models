Percentage of stock price changes with market volatility index value.

Volatility attempts to measure magnitude of price movements that a financial instrument experiences over a certain period of time. The more dramatic the price swings are in that instrument, the higher the level of volatility, and vice versa.

For Option traders, few important strategies are involved correctly predicting the stock price movement within a specific range.  Credit spreads or Iron condors are such strategy where it is very important to estimate stock price movement to place trade.  Now to predict that VIX could be one of such indicator as based on average market fear index.  As various stock price behaves differently , I would like to calculate percentage of change stock based on overall market volatility.
